          <h5> Cross Racing</h5>
          Cyclocross is a unique form of off-road bicycle racing that blends elements of road cycling, mountain biking, and running into one. It takes place on a closed circuit (made using tape, stakes and netting) with mixed surfaces, (including dirt, mud, grass, sand, gravel, and sometimes snow or ice) 
          The courses feature obstacles like barriers, stairs, and steep inclines, requiring riders to dismount and carry their bikes.
           Cyclocross is a winter sport, with the season generally running from September to February
